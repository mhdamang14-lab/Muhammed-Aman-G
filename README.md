device that continuously monitors gas levels using an MQ-2 sensor. When the gas concentration exceeds a preset threshold, it triggers a buzzer for local warning and updates the Firebase Realtime Database with gasLevel, fireStatus, and alertTime. The system autonomously resets when conditions return to safe levels, allowing real-time remote monitoring and fast response in residential or industrial environments.

Features :-
1.Realtime Monitoring: Gas levels and fire status are visible live on Firebase.
2.Autonomous Alert: System triggers the buzzer independently of network connectivity.
3.Auto-Reset: Buzzer and fire status reset when gas concentration drops below the threshold.
4.Simple Hardware: Uses minimal components (MQ-2 sensor, buzzer, NodeMCU).
5.Remote Logging: All events are logged for future reference.  
Applications
1.Home and office safety systems.
2.Industrial safety monitoring (LPG leaks, flammable gases).
3.Smart building integration with IoT dashboards.
